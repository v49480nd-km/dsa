This is not a real "project" this is just a practice repo for me. Anytime I learn
a new algorithm or data structure I will come here and add it to the header file.
I might possibly turn it into a library for myself and drop instructions if
you don't know how to do that. It is in C, but I will also likely try it in
different languages just to make sure I fully understand the concept.

## Installation
